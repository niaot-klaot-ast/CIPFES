The code of CIPFES (Characterization of Instrumental Profile for Fiber-fed Echelle Spectrograph) is written completely in Python. It uses the 1D spectra of a ThAr lamp on a fiber-fed echelle spectrograph to characterize the instrumental profile. CIPFES supports the backbone-residual model, Gauss-Hermit model and dis
