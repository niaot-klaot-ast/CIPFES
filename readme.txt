The code of CIPFES (Characterization of Instrumental Profile for Fiber-fed Echelle Spectrograph) is written completely in Python. It uses the spectra of ThAr lamp on a fiber-fed echelle spectrograph to characterize the instrumental profile (IP). 

global_IP_characterize_br.py: the IP characterization with the backbone-residual model.
global_IP_characterize_gh_dcp.py: the IP characterization with the Gauss-Hermite model and the discrete Chebyshev polynomial model.
IP_display_multiple_models.py: display the IP-characterization results of three models.
