CIPFES is a set of Python codes for the Characterization of Instrumental Profile for Fiber-fed Echelle Spectrograph.
It is based on the method proposed in the paper "The backbone-residual model â€“ accurately characterising the instrumental profile of a fibre-fed echelle spectrograph".

global_IP_characterize_br.py: the IP characterization with the backbone-residual model.
global_IP_characterize_gh_dcp.py: the IP characterization with the Gauss-Hermite model and the discrete Chebyshev polynomial model.
IP_display_multiple_models.py: display the IP-characterization results of three models.
IP_accuracy_br_mc.py: determine the IP-characterization accuracy of the backbone-residual model.
IP_accuracy_gh_mc.py: determine the IP-characterization accuracy of the Gauss-Hermite model.
IP_accuracy_cheby_mc.py: determine the IP-characterization accuracy of the discrete Chebyshev polynomial model.
IP_accuracy_sg_mc.py: determine the IP-characterization accuracy of the super Gaussian model.
ThAr_line_width_histogram.py: show the histogram of the intrinsic widths of ThAr emission lines.
